## when creating a new Doc page fallow these steps:

1) create the doc page in the src/stories folder with the .stories.mdx extension.
2) copy paste these first lines into the file:

`import { Canvas, Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';`
`<Meta title="SectionName/DocPageName"/>`


3) if the section you wanna create the doc page for doesn't exist yest, you can cerate a new section by defining it as "SectionName" (whatever that might be).
if the section already exists then just use the same section name in 'SectionName'
4) the 'DocPageName' should be the same as the file name, for example if the mdx file is called:
example.stories.mdx
then the 'DocPageName' will be 'example'.

yes, you can write in html here and also add styles, for more info on this look at the 'Introduction.stories.mdx' file in src/stories.
Also yes, you can just use MDX to write up the whole thing. for that ceck the [MDX docs](https://kabartolo.github.io/chicago-docs-demo/docs/mdx-guide/writing/)
