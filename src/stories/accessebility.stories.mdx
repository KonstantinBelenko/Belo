# Accessibility
All Airbnb products should be accessible to everyone. Our color accessibility is based upon Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA and AA standards. We have also incorporated readable content for people using assistive technology for various vision impairments, deaf or hard-of-hearing, and physical disabilities. To accommodate users with cognitive disabilities, we keep our language simplified and display content in a linear, spacious, and straightforward way.
