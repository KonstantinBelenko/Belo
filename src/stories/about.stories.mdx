# Get to know Belo
## What is Belo?
Based on the mantra, “to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere,” Belo is Airbnb’s open-source design system. We use it for building all our Airbnb products in order to give our guests and hosts the best possible user experience. Belo consists of design guidelines, a Figma UI kit, component documentation for development teams, and content guidelines.

## Who is Belo for?
Belo supports brand cohesion across multidisciplinary teams by providing valuable tools and support for eliminating repetitive work. Belo also helps to reduce misunderstandings amongst internal and external teams by sharing the same tools. Belo’s design system is for cross-functional design and development teams including developers, designers, product managers, marketers, and contractors. We provide tools in the form of open-source documentation, a cohesive user interface kit, and specified guidelines to help designers quickly create new patterns and pages, allowing us to build live products efficiently.
