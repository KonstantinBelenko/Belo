# Airbnb’s Voice
When communicating with our hosts and guests, Airbnb’s voice is positive and compassionate. We use a conversational voice for approachability and to relate to our audience in an engaging way. It’s also important to be more subtle in our communication in order to not compete with the content our hosts and guests produce on our platforms.

#### Straightforward
We want to be simple but also informative. When booking travel, it’s important our guests understand what actions they are taking and how to complete those tasks as easily as possible.

#### Inclusive
As many Airbnb guests and hosts speak many languages, it’s important we don’t use language that is difficult to understand or translate.

#### Empathetic
We care about our traveller's safety while on their trips. Whether it’s booking or hosting an experience, we need to remain professional on each step of their booking or experience creation journeys.

#### Subtle
Our voice is passive, so we don’t compete with the writing and opinions of our hosts and guests. We want your listings and reviews to shine. 

#### Tone
While Airbnb’s tone should be informal and approachable, it definitely depends on our user's situation. We need to put ourselves in the shoes of the host or guest—are they excited about a listing, are they having payment troubles, do they have safety issues and urgently need support from us? All of these situations will affect the tone we use when communicating. Being informal helps make our content more digestible, but it’s also important to remain professional when needed. In all written situations, it’s important to always remain positive, and clear, and use an active and actionable voice.
